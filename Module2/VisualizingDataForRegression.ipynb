This process is also known as **exploratory data analysis**. \n\nBefore creating analytical models, a data scientist must develop an understanding of the properties and relationships in a dataset. There are two goals for data exploration and visualization. First to understand the relationships between the data columns. Second to identify features that may be useful for predicting labels in machine learning projects. Additionally, redundant, collinear features can be identified. Thus, visualization for data exploration is an essential data science skill.\n\nIn this module you will explore two datasets. Specifically, in this lab, your first goal is to explore a dataset that includes information about automobile pricing. In other labs you will use what you learn through visualization to create a solution that predicts the price of an automobile based on its characteristics. This type of predictive modeling, in which you attempt to predict a real numeric value, is known as **regression**; and it will be discussed in more detail later in the course. For now, the focus of this lab is on visually exploring the data to determine which features may be useful in predicting automobile prices."

Specifically you will learn:\n\n- **Summarizing and manipulating data**:\n  * How large is it?\n  * What columns are of interest?\n  * What are the characteristics of the data derived from summary statistics and counts?\n- **Developing multiple views of complex data** using multiple chart types. Exploring complex data requires multiple views to understand the many relationships. It is impossible to develop a complete understanding from just a few plots.\n- **Overview of Matplotlib, Pandas plotting and Seaborn** which are commonly used Python plotting packages. \n- **Overview of univariate plot types** is a review of creating these basic plots using three Python packages. These plot types allow you to study the distributional properties of the variables in your data set. \n- **Overview of two dimensional plot types** is a review of creating basic plot types used to construct visualizations. These plots naturally display the relationship between two variables on the 2-d computer graphics display. \n- **Using Aesthetics** is an overview of how to project additional plot dimensions using plot aesthetics. Using aesthetics provides a method for projecting additional dimensions onto the 2-d computer graphics display. \n- **Facetted plotting** also know as conditioned plotting or lattice plotting, introduces a powerful method for visualizing higher dimensional data. Arrays of plots of subsets of the data are arranged on the 2-d computer graphics display. \n- **Using Matplotlib methods** to add attributes to plots, such as titles and axis labels. "

Over plotting is a serious problem when scatter plots are applied to large datasets. Serious over plotting can render a plot meaningless or uninterpretable. \n\nFortunately, there are several good ways to deal with over plotting:\n1. Use **transparency** of the points to allow the view to see though points. With mild over plotting this approach can be quite effective.\n2. **Countour plots** or **2d density plots** show the density of points, much as a topographic map shows elevation. Generating the contours has high computational complexity and making this method unsuitable for massive datasets.\n3. **Hexbin plots** are the two-dimensional analog of a histogram. The density of the shading in the hexagonal cells indicates the density of points. Generating hexbins is computationally efficient and can be applied to massive datasets.\n\nThe code in the cell below modifies the scatter plot function used previously to add a transparency argument.

The range of the **inner two quartiles** are contained within the box. The lenght of the box shows the **interquartile range**. A line within the box shows the median. **Wiskers** extend for the maximum of 1.5 times the interquartile range or the extreme value of the data. Outliers beyond the wiskers are shown in a symbol. \n2. **Violine plots** which are a variation on the 1d KDE plot. Two back to back KDE curves are used to show the density estimate. \n\nBox plots of violin plots can be arranged side by side with data of the numerical variable grouped by the categories of the categorical variable.

But, with complex datasets it is useful to view multiple dimensions on each plot. The question is, how can this be done when graphics displays are limited to two dimensions? \n\nIn this section, plot aesthetics are used to project additional dimensions. Some aesthetics are useful only for categorical variables, while others are useful for numeric variables. Keep in mind that not all plot aesthetics are equally effective. Tests of human perceptions have shown that people are very good as noticing small differences in position. This fact explains why scatter plots are so effective. In rough order of effectiveness these aesthetics are:\n1. **Marker shape** is an effective indicator variable category. It is critical to select shapes which are easily distinguished by the viewer. \n2. **Marker size** shows values of a numeric variable. Be careful, as size is the span across the marker, not the area. \n3. **Marker color** is useful as an indicator of variable category. Color is the least effective of these three aesthetics in terms of human perception. Colors should be chosen to appear distinct. Additionally, keep in mind that many people, particularly men are red-green color blind. \n\nCategorical aesthetics, such as marker shape and color, are only effective if the differences in markers are perceptable. Using too many shapes or color creates a situation where the viewer cannot tell the differences between the categories. Typically a limit of about five to seven categories should be observed. "

Aesthetics and multiple axis methods allow projection of higher dimensions onto the 2d plot surface. \n\nSpecifically in this lab you:\n\n1. Used summary statistics to understand the basics of a data set.\n2. Used several types of plots to display distributions.\n3. Created scatter plots with different transparency. \n4. Used density plots and hex bin plots to overcome overplotting. \n5. Applied aesthetics to project additional dimensions of categorical and numeric variables onto a 2d plot surface. \n6. Used pair-wise scatter plots and conditioned plots to create displays with multiple axes. "
